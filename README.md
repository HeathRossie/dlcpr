# dlcpr, R package for processing tracking data
This package is data processing toolkits for tracking data from DeepLabCut

DeepLabCut is a software for tracking animal movement and pose estimation based on deep learning (https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut). It is available on Python, and produces tracking results easily.

Despite easiness to use DeepLabCut, a more tricky part is to pre-process raw trajectory data before real analysis. 
This package is a processing toolkit for that.
